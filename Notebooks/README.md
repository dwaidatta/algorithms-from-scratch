Welcome to **From Scratch**!

This documentation explores and explains the implementation of a wide variety of algorithms across diverse fields in Computer Science and Applied Sciences — including **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, **Data Science**, **Signal and Image Processing**, **Digital Logic**, **Optimisation Algorithms**, **Advanced Data Structures**, **Mathematics**, **Physics**, **Operating Systems**, **Computer Architecture**, **Networking**, **Databases**, and more.

What makes this project unique? Every algorithm is built **from first principles**, with **minimal dependency on external libraries**, focusing on **educational clarity**, **hands-on logic building**, and **conceptual understanding**.

## 🚀 Project Philosophy

- **Learn by Doing:**  
  Understand the core workings of algorithms by implementing them yourself.  
  No black-box usage — pure white-box insight.

- **Challenge Yourself:**  
  Can you code your favourite algorithm *without* using prebuilt libraries? Try it!

- **Minimal Dependencies:**  
  Avoid using libraries like `NumPy`, `scikit-learn`, `TensorFlow`, etc., for core implementation.  
  Use standard libraries *only* for auxiliary tasks like plotting or symbolic math.

- **Comprehensive Topics:**  
  From machine learning to mathematical physics, we aim to cover a wide range of foundational topics.

- **Readable & Well-Commented:**  
  Code is clean, intuitive, and well-documented, with markdown explanations embedded where appropriate.

## 💡 Why From Scratch?

We believe that true understanding comes from **first recreating** what we use.  
When you strip away the library abstractions, you're left with pure logic — and that's where deep learning (the human kind) begins.

This project encourages:

- Building your CS foundation.
- Improving algorithmic thinking.
- Preparing for interviews, research, and system-level programming.
- Contributing to educational open-source content.

## 🤝 Contribution Guidelines

We welcome all contributors interested in this learning-by-doing philosophy!

- Build something new? Add it!
- See a better way to implement an algorithm? Improve it!
- Spotted a bug? Fix it!
- Want to write explanations or add visuals? Go ahead!

Please ensure your code is:

- Written with core logic (no shortcuts using major libraries).
- Clear, readable, and well-commented.
- Ideally accompanied by markdown-based explanations or visualizations.

## ✨ A Student-Led Initiative

> *From Scratch* is created and maintained by students of the **Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Kalyani Government Engineering College**.

Originally initiated in **May 2025** by **Nirjhar Debnath**, this project aims to build a collaborative knowledge base that demystifies the complexity of modern computational methods — by rebuilding them from scratch.

*Let’s break the illusion of magic in algorithms. Let’s build them, understand them, and improve them — together.* 🚀---

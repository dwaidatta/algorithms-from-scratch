# Algorithms From Scratch

Welcome to **Algorithms From Scratch**!  
This repository is dedicated to implementing a wide variety of algorithms across topics in Computer Science-including Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Signal Processing, and more-**without relying on major libraries**. Our goal is to understand and code each algorithm from first principles, focusing on clarity, educational value, and hands-on learning.

---

## 🚀 Project Goals

- **Learn by Doing:** Deepen understanding by building algorithms from the ground up.
- **Minimal Dependencies:** Avoid major libraries (like NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc.); use only basic language features and minimal standard libraries where necessary.
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** Tackle algorithms from ML, DL, signal processing, and other CS fields.
- **Readable & Well-Documented:** Ensure code is easy to follow, well-commented, and accompanied by explanations.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. **Fork the repository:**  
   Click the "Fork" button at the top right of this page to create your own copy of the repository.

2. **Clone your forked repository:**

```
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-forked-repo-name>.git`
```

3. **Explore the folders:**  
Each topic contains standalone scripts for individual algorithms.

4. **Run the code:**  
Most scripts are self-contained and can be run directly with Python 3.x:

```
python machine_learning/linear_regression.py
```

5. **Read the explanations:**  
Each script contains comments and, where appropriate, markdown explanations to clarify the algorithm’s logic.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- **Machine Learning:** Linear Regression, K-Means, Decision Trees, etc.
- **Deep Learning:** Basic Neural Networks, Backpropagation, etc.
- **Signal Processing:** Discrete Fourier Transform, Filtering, etc.
- **Other CS Algorithms:** Sorting, Search, Graph Algorithms, and more.

## 💡 Why This Approach?

By avoiding major libraries, we force ourselves to truly understand how each algorithm works under the hood. This is a great way to learn, teach, and demystify the magic behind modern software and data science.
